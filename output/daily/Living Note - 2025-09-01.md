- Labor Day recorded 212 hot dogs and ~52% bundle uptake, Coca‑Cola sold out—indicates high demand and restock priority.
- Pre-scored buns and condiment layout reduced wait times; add third tongs and extra ice to prevent service bottlenecks.
- Weekend plan shifts cart location, adds $6 pretzel+soda bundle, assigns staffing and orders to meet higher tourist demand.

### Proposed Questions for AI Agent

- Given the Labor Day totals (212 dogs, 28 pretzels, 91 drinks) and current on‑hand inventory, can you calculate reorder quantities for a 3‑day busy weekend with 20% safety stock (buns, dogs, drinks prioritizing Coke/Diet, ice, condiments) and produce a suggested ordering schedule/timelines?

- Research veggie‑dog suppliers suitable for a street cart: list 3 vendors (local wholesalers or distributors), include unit cost, minimum order, lead time, refrigeration requirements, and a suggested retail price that preserves current margin on the $8 bundle.

- Using bundle uptake data (~52% Labor Day, ~40% lunch rush), simulate revenue and margin scenarios for (a) keeping $8, (b) raising to $9, and (c) introducing a $6 “Pretzel + Soda” bundle — show projected daily revenue for 180–220 dogs and impact on average wait times.

- Draft a short reply/recipe to share with the Brazilian tour group about the onion sauce (include ingredients and approximate prep steps) and suggest a brief script for staff if customers ask for the recipe in person.

### Metrics

- Files affected: 11
- Lines: +410/-0
- New notes: 11
- Documented weekend market expansion strategy introducing family bundles, dynamic weather-based pricing to increase average order value and reach families
- Recorded lemonade-stand experiments: kids-cup sizing, adjusted prices, loyalty cards and upsells improving conversions and near-target sales
- Hot-dog cart shows bundle promotions drove substantial share (~40–52%), high Labor Day volume; restocking and ice capacity require scaling

### Proposed Questions for AI Agent

- Using the sales snapshots and Labor Day totals, forecast inventory needs (lemons, sugar, ice, cups, buns, dogs, condiments) for the next four weekend days with similar weather and provide reorder quantities and suggested reorder dates to avoid stockouts.

- Run a margin-impact analysis for the proposed family bundle and kids-cup pricing: show revenue, gross margin, and break-even uplift vs current mix at 3 price points and recommend the optimal price/bundle that balances AOV and parent sensitivity.

- Propose a dynamic-pricing rule set tied to weather and foot-traffic signals (temperature bands, rain, time-of-day, weekend vs weekday) with concrete price adjustments, communication copy for signage, and guardrails to maintain customer goodwill.

- Design a 2-week A/B test to validate the "kids cup" size/pricing and family-bundle offers: specify sample sizes, metrics to track (conversion, AOV, repeat visits), allocation method, timeline, and how to analyze results.

- Added weekend market expansion strategy targeting family locations with family bundles, kids cup, and dynamic pricing.
- Launched loyalty and pricing experiments — punch card, refill discount, add-ons — to increase retention and average order value.
- Recorded customer interactions driving immediate actions: vendor collaborations, honey-lemon special, permits, and pop-up partner deals boosting sales.

### Proposed Questions for AI Agent

- How would you optimize family-bundle pricing (e.g., 2 adult drinks + 2 kids cups) using current unit costs and menu prices to maximize revenue while holding gross margin ≥ 30% — show revenue/margin for 3–5 price points and sensitivity to conversion rates?

- Can you draft 3 short signage/visual concepts (headline, 2–3 bullet layout points, color hints, and ideal physical sizes/placement) that highlight the “kids cup,” family bundles, and an easy QR/loyalty call-to-action for family-oriented locations?

- Propose a concrete dynamic-pricing rule set tied to weather (temp bands, rain) and observed foot-traffic levels — include exact thresholds, price adjustments or bundle triggers, short in-stand messaging, and a 4-week test plan with metrics to evaluate impact.

- Design an A/B test for the new kids-cup size and pricing: define variants, required sample sizes/duration, primary & secondary metrics (AOV, cups sold per transaction, queue time), and clear criteria for choosing a winner and scaling.

- Added multiple customer interaction logs documenting product experiments and partner leads enabling new offers and pop-up opportunities
- Implemented loyalty and pricing tests: punch-card, BYO bottle discount, driver quick-pick, cookie add-on, dynamic weather pricing
- Operational updates: permit/health requirements, POS/menu presets, influencer promotion, and metric-driven weekend market expansion plan

### Proposed Questions for AI Agent

- Help me design a 10-stamp punch-card program: recommended price threshold per stamp, expiration policy, simple tracking method, and conservative uplift assumptions to test over 6 weeks.  
- Compare expected margin and revenue impact for these upsells—cookie add-on ($1), honey‑lemon special, and 1‑gallon pre‑chilled jug—and, given ingredient cost inputs I’ll provide, suggest prices that meet a >30% gross margin.  
- Draft a concise outreach email (subject + 1 short paragraph) to the office building manager proposing a Fri 11–1 pop-up, including the space/permit/handwash needs.  
- Create a 4-week A/B test plan (metrics to track, daily sample targets, schedule, and success criteria) to evaluate punch-card launch, driver quick‑pick offering, and kids‑cup pricing across weekend vs weekday shifts.

- Produce three short sign/layout options (headline, 2-line body, CTA, recommended size/material) to promote the kids cup + family bundle for weekend market stalls.

- Create a prioritized operational checklist for the weekend market expansion (permits, handwash/food-safety, staffing schedule, inventory targets, pricing script, and 3 quick experiments to run first weekend).
