### Proposed Questions for AI Agent

- From the Prep Log, Labor Day Recap, and Daily Setup notes, which 6 operational fixes should be prioritized this week (e.g., third tong, extra ice bag, cooler drain), and can you build a 7-day schedule with owner/assignee and deadlines?

- Using the Weekly Financial Digest and Revenue Breakdown, identify 3 targeted margin-improvement actions (cost or pricing changes, supply swaps, or upsell tweaks), and estimate the expected weekly dollar and percentage impact for each.

- Combine Inventory & Costs, Prep Log par-cook cycles, and upcoming event plans to create a reorder plan: set par levels, reorder quantities, lead times, and a reorder trigger for buns, dogs, onions, and propane.

- Based on the Customer Experience Playbook and Lunch Rush/Labor Day feedback, draft a 6-question customer survey plus a simple A/B test (spicy mustard vs. no spicy mustard) to measure demand and satisfaction; include target sample size and how to interpret results.
