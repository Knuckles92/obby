- Launched weekend market expansion targeting families with kids-cup and family bundle pricing, increasing average order value.  
- Tested loyalty punch-cards, BYOB discount, bulk pre-chill and quick-pick offers to boost repeat purchases.  
- Secured collaborations and pop-up opportunities (beekeepers, food trucks, influencer tags) driving new traffic channels.

### Proposed Questions for AI Agent

- Draft a concise email (subject + 3 short paragraphs) I can send to the Office Park building manager requesting a Fri 11:00–1:00 pop-up: include ask about permits, handwashing requirements, liability/insurance, suggested revenue split or vendor fee, and proposed menu/price list.

- Run a profitability model for the Daily Note targets (sell 85, 95, 110 cups) using the listed inventory and prices: show revenue, estimated variable costs (lemons, sugar, cups, cookies), and resulting gross margin; flag break-even points and the margin impact of the “Buy 2, get a cookie for $1” add-on and the $0.50 refill discount.

- Create three high-visibility sign drafts (15–20 ft readable) with headline + 1-line benefit for these promos: “Buy 2 → Cookie $1,” “Bring-Your-Bottle — $0.50 Off,” and “Honey Lemon Weekend Special (local beekeeper).” Include suggested colors/fonts/icons for quick printing.

- Propose a simple punch-card system (stamp rules, expiration, POS flow) and three short customer-facing lines I can use to launch it (on sign/receipt/IG story) targeted at repeat office customers and weekday curbside buyers.
