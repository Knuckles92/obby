### Metrics

- Total changes: 9
- Files affected: 8
- Lines: +450/-0
- New notes: 8
- Introduced multiple revenue experiments: bulk pre-chilled gallons, honey-collab, cookie and family bundles to increase average order value
- Launched loyalty and pricing tests: punch-card, dynamic weather-based pricing, kids-cup and refill discounts to boost retention
- Validated tactics that improve foot traffic: influencer reel +7 visits, food-truck sync +4 cups, signage and no-ice option

### Proposed Questions for AI Agent

- Propose 3 family-bundle price options (e.g., 2 adult + 2 kids cups ± cookie) with estimated per-bundle cost, gross margin, and recommended uptake assumptions to test which maximizes revenue without alienating budget-conscious parents.  
- Calculate an inventory/order list for a target of 95 cups (breakdown: lemons, sugar, water/ice, cups, cookies), include a 15% safety buffer and reorder trigger points.  
- Draft a short email to the building manager requesting permission for a Fri 11:00–1:00 pop-up (mention permit/handwash needs, proposed set-up, and offer a comp sample), plus a suggested subject line.  
- Design a 2-week A/B test plan comparing “Honey Lemon” weekend special vs Classic (sample size per arm, signage copy, success metrics like conversion and upsell rate, schedule, and criteria for declaring a winner).

- Weekend market expansion targets family-oriented locations with dynamic pricing and family bundles to increase average order value.
- Loyalty and promotional tests (punch cards, add-ons, kids cup, refill and bulk offers) to boost repeat visits.
- Customer interaction insights led to improved signage, vendor partnerships, permit compliance, and influencer opportunities increasing visibility and sales.

### Proposed Questions for AI Agent

- Analyze the new notes and customer logs to estimate family-buying behavior and recommend optimal family-bundle and kids-cup price points — model revenue outcomes for kids-cup prices $0.75–$1.75 and bundle discounts of 10–30% across conversion rates 10%–50%.

- Draft two sign layouts (copy + visual priorities): one promo board for the family bundle and one smaller kids-cup callout for the stand — include headline, 2-line subtext, clear price badge, suggested font weight/size, and 3 color palette options for outdoor readability.

- Propose a concrete dynamic-pricing rule set mapping temperature, weather (clear/drizzle), and foot-traffic bands to price adjustments or bundle offers (e.g., +X% or add BOGO), list required data sources/sensors, and suggest an A/B test plan to validate the rules.

- Produce an inventory forecast and prep schedule for three weekend locations (assume target sales 200 / 150 / 100 cups) under warm (≥85°F) and cool (≤75°F) scenarios — include lemons, sugar, ice, cups, reorder points, and suggested batch prep timing.

- Launched weekend market expansion targeting families with kids-cup and family bundle pricing, increasing average order value.  
- Tested loyalty punch-cards, BYOB discount, bulk pre-chill and quick-pick offers to boost repeat purchases.  
- Secured collaborations and pop-up opportunities (beekeepers, food trucks, influencer tags) driving new traffic channels.

### Proposed Questions for AI Agent

- Draft a concise email (subject + 3 short paragraphs) I can send to the Office Park building manager requesting a Fri 11:00–1:00 pop-up: include ask about permits, handwashing requirements, liability/insurance, suggested revenue split or vendor fee, and proposed menu/price list.

- Run a profitability model for the Daily Note targets (sell 85, 95, 110 cups) using the listed inventory and prices: show revenue, estimated variable costs (lemons, sugar, cups, cookies), and resulting gross margin; flag break-even points and the margin impact of the “Buy 2, get a cookie for $1” add-on and the $0.50 refill discount.

- Create three high-visibility sign drafts (15–20 ft readable) with headline + 1-line benefit for these promos: “Buy 2 → Cookie $1,” “Bring-Your-Bottle — $0.50 Off,” and “Honey Lemon Weekend Special (local beekeeper).” Include suggested colors/fonts/icons for quick printing.

- Propose a simple punch-card system (stamp rules, expiration, POS flow) and three short customer-facing lines I can use to launch it (on sign/receipt/IG story) targeted at repeat office customers and weekday curbside buyers.
