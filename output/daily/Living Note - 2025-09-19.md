### Proposed Questions for AI Agent

- Using the Labor Day recap (212 dogs, 28 pretzels, 91 drinks) and the 8/29 inventory snapshot, calculate recommended order quantities for buns, dogs, drinks (Coke/Diet prioritized), ice, and condiment bottles for one comparable high‑traffic day—include a 15–20% safety stock and estimated cost per item.

- Research 3 wholesale veggie/plant‑based hot dog suppliers that can deliver to Midtown NYC: for each, list unit price, minimum order qty, packaging/storage requirements, lead time, and a suggested retail price to test a veggie‑dog offering.

- Create a concise SOP checklist (equipment list + step sequence) for pretzel handling and condiment management: include acquiring a third tong set, physical layout changes to prevent cross‑contamination, and an ice management plan (extra bag + divider placement) to keep average wait <4 minutes.

- Analyze bundle performance across notes (Labor Day ~52%, lunch rush bundle 40%, weekend plan target) and model 2–3 pricing scenarios (e.g., keep $8, raise to $9, add pretzel+soda $6) showing projected revenue and margin impacts based on recent sales mix.
