### Proposed Questions for AI Agent

- For Bed A's early blight note, draft a 14–21 day monitoring and treatment protocol with specific scouting checkpoints, symptom thresholds that trigger reapplication of copper (or alternative organic options), and a simple log template to record outcomes.

- Create a distribution and application plan for the 50 lbs of organic fertilizer (compost, bone meal, kelp): per-bed/plot rates for tomatoes, lettuce, and herbs, timing relative to planting/transplant, and a small checklist for volunteers to follow during fall amendments.

- Using the Monthly Financial Digest (revenue $4,680; operating profit $890), identify the top three levers to reach a 25% operating margin within three months, show modeled impacts (revenue uplift vs. cost reduction) and practical next steps to implement each.

- For Spud Stop: propose SOPs to handle the russet lot sprouting (storage temp, rotation, discount/quick-use crates), plus a fryer oil maintenance schedule and ordering cadence to reduce COGS by ~5% without hurting quality.

### Proposed Questions for AI Agent

- Can you analyze the Aug 27 lunch-rush sales (92 dogs, 37 sodas, 40% bundle adoption) and calculate the per-item and bundle gross margin so I can see whether the $8 "2 dogs + soda" price is optimal or should be adjusted to hit a 50% bundle take rate?

- Using the Aug 29 on‑hand counts and the weekend target of 180 dogs/day, create a replenishment plan (quantities, reorder timing, safety stock) for buns, dogs, condiments, drinks, and propane to avoid stockouts for Aug 30–31.

- Draft a concise ops checklist for the Times Sq weekend shift (W 44th & 7th, 5–9 PM) that includes staffing assignments/cash handling, inventory staging (extra napkins/change bank), the pretzel-warming-rack test procedure, and how to capture the success metrics (sales, wait time).

- Several Spud Stop files (Customer Experience Playbook, Market Strategy, Prep Log) were removed on Oct 7; can you restore or summarize the Sept 19 versions and recommend which sections to keep, update, or discard before re-publishing?
