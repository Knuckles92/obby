# Living Note Formatting Preferences

**ULTRA-CONCISE SUMMARIES ONLY**

## Core Rules
- Maximum 3-5 lines total per entry
- One sentence per section maximum  
- Skip minor changes, formatting, or routine tasks
- Focus only on substantive work: features, fixes, insights

## Format
```
**Brief**: [One sentence: what actually changed]
**Impact**: [One sentence: why it matters or what it enables]  
**Next**: [Optional: one quick actionable item]
```

## What to Include
- New features or significant functionality
- Problem-solving and bug fixes
- Important technical discoveries
- Workflow improvements that save time

## What to Skip
- File additions/deletions unless they're major features
- Metadata like topics, keywords, timestamps
- Minor edits or cosmetic changes
- Verbose explanations of obvious changes
- Generic insights about "development patterns"

## Tone
Direct and practical. Write like you're leaving a quick note for yourself about what actually got done today.
