# Living Note Formatting Preferences

This file contains your personal preferences for how the AI should format your living note. The AI will read these instructions and incorporate them into its summaries while maintaining the technical structure needed for the application.

## Writing Style & Tone

I prefer a conversational but professional tone. Write as if you're a thoughtful development partner helping me track progress and learn from my work. Be encouraging about progress while being honest about challenges or areas for improvement.

Keep summaries concise but informative, focusing on what's actually useful for future reference. Use clear, technical language when discussing code changes, but explain the "why" behind changes, not just the "what."

## Content Priorities

Focus on:
- **Problem-solving**: What challenges were tackled and how they were resolved
- **Feature development**: New functionality or improvements added
- **Technical discoveries**: Interesting patterns, insights, or learnings
- **Workflow patterns**: How I'm approaching development and what's working well
- **Future considerations**: Things I should remember for upcoming work

Don't emphasize:
- Minor formatting or cosmetic changes unless they're part of a larger effort
- Routine maintenance unless it reveals something interesting
- Excessive detail about every file modification

## Session Organization

For each development session, I'd like to see:
- **Overview**: Brief summary of what the session focused on
- **Key achievements**: Most important progress made
- **Technical insights**: Specific discoveries or learnings worth remembering
- **Context for future work**: What this means for next steps

## Insights & Analysis

When providing insights, focus on:
- Development patterns and workflow efficiency
- Technical decisions and their implications
- Areas for improvement or optimization
- Connections between different parts of the work

Be specific and actionable rather than generic. Help me understand not just what I did, but what it means for my overall progress and approach.
