## Random Notes

- Just added some thoughts about the project structure
- The AI integration seems really powerful for summarizing changes
- Need to remember to check the theme system - looks like there are 11 different themes available
- Wondering about the performance of the FTS5 search with larger note collections
- The real-time monitoring with watchdog is pretty neat
- Should explore the semantic search capabilities more
- Living Note feature could be useful for daily journaling
- The batch AI processing sounds efficient for handling multiple changes

## Ideas for Later

- Test the ignore patterns functionality
- Try out different OpenAI models
- Experiment with custom prompt templates
- Check out the cyberpunk theme in the mocks directory

## Development Notes

- Backend serves at :8001, frontend dev at :5173
- SQLite database with connection pooling
- React + TypeScript frontend
- Flask API with SSE for real-time updates
